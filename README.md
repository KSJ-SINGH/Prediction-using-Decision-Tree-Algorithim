## Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithim
#### Author: Kunwardeep Singh Jagdev
 
---
## Project Goals: 
- Create a classifier which is able to predict the right class of the any new data fed to it.
---
## Prerequisites:
In order to perform the intended test, I'll using `python3` as the main programming language and `Jupyter Notebook` as the computing platform.
I'll also require the below mentioned libraries to perform complete the task.
   1. Pandas
   2. Numpy
   3. Plotly
   4. Matplotlib
   5. Scikit-learn
   6. pydotplus

If you do not have these libraries installed in your machine, Kindly run one of the below mentioned command.
> I recommend creating a `virtual environment` because it helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python `virtual environments` for them.

```bash
# if you use pip Packager
pip install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib notebook scikit-learn pydotplus
```
```bash
# If you are using conda Packager
conda install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib notebook scikit-learn pydotplus
```

## Dataset:
The dataset used in the implementation is the Iris dataset (See Table 3.1 and Fig. 3.1) with four attributes, `sepal length`, `sepal width`, `petal length`, and `petal width` and a Species label to identify the species of flower, viz., `Iris setosa`, `Iris versicolor`, and `Iris virginica`.
